    <h2> SECTION 1 </h2>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The species that I will be focusing on for this project is the freshwater 
      jellyfish (also known as the craspedacusta sowerbii). It is believed that they have existed on earth
      for up to 600 million years, they were considerd an endangerd species in 2002. Humans hunt some species
       of jellyfish that are edible, jellyfish is used in some dishes including salads and sushi however, 
       scienctists have said jellyfish are not a signifigant item on the sea food menu because they are made up 
       of 95% water and have very little calories. Even though they aren't a very good source of calories it
       is said there are other possible benefits which include as having important nutrients like protein and 
       antioxidants. Freshwater jellyfish are very sensitive to changes in their environment and human interventions 
      such as water pollution have caused their population to lower.
